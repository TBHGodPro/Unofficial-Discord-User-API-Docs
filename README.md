# The Project

This project was made using devtools with google chrome and electron, do note that all of our testing comes from known sources and desktop productions of discord.

There may be endpoints on the mobile app that we cannot analyze.

We try our best to stay up to date as we also use these docs for our own use.

> The creators: [TBHGodPro](https://github.com/TBHGodPro)

> <h3>NOTE:</h3><br />The Docs Will Be In The Order Of When You'll Use Each Part <small>(Logging In First, Connecting To Gateway Second, etc...)</small>
